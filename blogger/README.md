Access it at [heroku](https://secure-castle-16877.herokuapp.com/)

From the Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails?ref=lnav)

In this project I will demonstrate the basic principles used when build a ruby on rails application according to the MVC model.
